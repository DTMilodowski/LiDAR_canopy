# Frechet number calculation - this algorithm was coded up by Max Bareiss and 
# can be found here:
#     https://www.snip2code.com/Snippet/76076/Fr-chet-Distance-in-Python
# The Frechet number is a metric to describe the similarity of two curves.  In
# this instance the curves are simplified to polygonal curves of an arbitrary
# number of points, giving the discrete Frechet difference.  This approximation # gives great advantages with respect to performance.
# The original algorithm was developed here:
